            <p>
                I am a Service Engineer with a background in automation and a Master’s 
                degree in Computer Engineering. My experience includes optimizing test 
                processes with tools like Simulink, CANoe, and CAPL, as well as automating workflows using Python and CI/CD pipelines.
                I am skilled in software testing, system configuration, and supporting both hardware and software needs.
                I’m passionate about tackling new challenges and continually expanding my technical expertise.
